# Client360 Platform Architecture

**Status:** Authoritative top-level architecture reference. Reflects the code as it exists
after **Phase D.30** on `release/0.13.0` (migration head `z4e5f6a7b8c9`, 778 routes, 157
seeded production capabilities). Phase documents (`docs/PHASE_D*.md`,
`docs/ADVISOR_WORKSPACE_ARCHITECTURE.md`, domain release docs) remain the historical,
phase-specific record and are not superseded.

A machine-readable companion, `docs/platform_architecture_manifest.yaml`, encodes the
verifiable facts here (route count, migration head, capabilities, module list, import
direction, schema registration). `tests/test_platform_architecture.py` validates the
manifest against the live code so this document cannot silently drift.

> This document separates **implemented architecture**, **known limitations**, **planned
> extension points**, and **prohibited patterns**. Anything under "Extension points" is *not*
> implemented. Client360 is **not** event-sourced, **not** an AI/LLM system, and has **no**
> workflow engine, event bus, or message queue.

## 1. Purpose and authority
This is the single top-level answer to: what domains exist, who owns each type of data, which
services are authoritative, which layers merely compose, what dependency directions are
allowed, which capabilities protect each domain, how scope is enforced, which domains emit
timeline events or create Advisor Work, what Annual Review and Business Owner Planning reuse,
what data is unavailable, and where future phases may extend without duplicating logic.

It is descriptive of current code, not aspirational. Where code does not support a principle,
the exception is documented rather than hidden.

## 2. Current platform overview
Client360 is a server-rendered (FastAPI + Jinja2) practice-management platform over SQLAlchemy
Core + PostgreSQL + Alembic, with capability-based RBAC, record-level scope, append-only audit
and domain ledgers, and deterministic (non-AI) advisor intelligence. Data flows from
authoritative **source domains** up through read-first **composition layers**:

```
                 Identity / Auth / Users / Principals / Capabilities / Record scope
                                          │
   ┌───────────────── source (authoritative) domains ─────────────────┐
   People · Households · Relationship entities/Organizations/Ownership ·
   Source contacts/links · Matching/Canonical merge · Accounts/Portfolio ·
   Tax · Retirement · Benefits · Insurance · Rule Catalog · Compliance ·
   Reviewer Authority · Advisor Work · Documents/Evidence · Exceptions/Ops ·
   Importers · Advisor Intelligence (deterministic producer)
   └───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
                                          │  (read-only, capability-gated)
   ┌──────────────────── composition layers ──────────────────────────┐
   Client 360 / Meeting Workspace → Activity Timeline (projection) →
   Annual Review → Business Owner Planning
   └───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

## 3. Architectural principles
Each verified against code for D.12A. ✅ = holds; ⚠️ = holds with a documented exception.

- ✅ **One authoritative owner per domain** (source-of-truth matrix, §5).
- ✅ **Composition layers consume, never duplicate** — Annual Review and Business Owner Planning
  add no business logic; they call owning services.
- ✅ **Server-side authorization** — `require_capability` dependencies + middleware; no
  client-side enforcement.
- ✅ **Scope-first reads** — services check `record_in_scope` before returning data.
- ✅ **Restricted ≠ missing** — e.g. EIN present-flag derives from ciphertext, not view
  permission.
- ✅ **No mutation during incidental rendering** — Business Owner Planning uses a *pure*
  ownership read (`list_person_business_ownership`) that never calls `ensure_person_entity`.
- ✅ **No fabricated history / calculations / relationships** — recommendations excluded from
  the timeline (no durable timestamp); owner comp / tax figures / valuation shown "Not
  available"; ownership never inferred from names/free text.
- ✅ **No hidden recommendation engine** — recommendations come only from `advisor_intelligence`
  (deterministic rules).
- ✅ **No hidden workflow engine** — Advisor Work is an explicit status set with an
  allowed-transition map; no automatic creation.
- ✅ **No second event table** — exactly one `timeline_events`; the Activity Timeline is a read
  projection over it plus existing domain ledgers.
- ✅ **Deterministic identifiers** — stable timeline event ids; deterministic recommendation ids.
- ✅ **Bounded queries / no uncontrolled N+1** — per-source caps, batched actor/owner name
  resolution.
- ✅ **Linear migrations** — single Alembic head (§21).
- ✅ **Additive reads belong to the owning service** — `person_work`, `person_reviews`,
  `business_engagements`, `business_policies`, `list_person_business_ownership` live on their
  owning services.
- ✅ **Regulatory approval stays inside authorized Compliance** — final approval double-gates on
  `compliance.review.decide` **and** a recorded Reviewer Authority.
- ⚠️ **Source-domain behavior stable under composition** — holds; the one nuance is that the
  pre-existing `organization_service.list_owned` performs an upsert side effect via
  `ensure_person_entity`, so composition layers use the new pure reads instead (documented in
  §17).

## 5. Source-of-truth matrix
"Mutation from composition layer?" is **No** for every source datum — composition layers link
to the owning service instead.

## 6. Dependency architecture
Verified from actual imports (D.12A audit). Allowed direction is **consumer → producer**;
producers never import consumers or composition layers.

```
composition:  business_owner ─┐
                              ├─► annual_review ─► advisor_workspace / activity_timeline
              business_owner ─┼─► organization_service, tax_domain, benefits_domain,
                              │    insurance, compliance/reviews, advisor_work, activity_timeline
              annual_review ──┴─► advisor_intelligence, advisor_work, activity_timeline, compliance
producers:    advisor_work, annual_review, business_owner, compliance/{reviews,rule_catalog}
                                 └─► advisor_intelligence   (read recommendations)
```

Verified invariants (all clean):
- `advisor_intelligence` imports **none** of its consumers (advisor_work / annual_review /
  business_owner / activity_timeline).
- Source producers (`advisor_intelligence`, `advisor_work`, `compliance/reviews`) do **not**
  import `activity_timeline` — the Timeline adapters depend on source domains, not the reverse.
- No source domain imports `annual_review` or `business_owner`.
- `business_owner` sits at the top of the stack (imported by no service).
- Compliance logic stays in `compliance/*`; Benefits in `benefits_domain`; Tax in `tax_domain`;
  business ownership in `organization_service`.

No accidental circular or upward dependencies were found. The single intentional
composition-consumes-composition edge is `business_owner → annual_review` (higher layer reads
the latest review), which is downward and expected.

## 7. Composition layers
| Layer | Consumes | Owns / persists | Must not mutate | Mandatory capabilities | Source of truth? |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Client 360 / Meeting Workspace | portfolio, insurance, tax, benefits, tasks, exceptions, timeline | nothing (meeting outcomes route to owning services) | any source datum | `client.read` (+ owning caps per panel) | No |
| Activity Timeline | `timeline_events`, `advisor_work_events`, `compliance_reviews/decisions` | nothing (pure projection, no table) | source rows | `timeline.read` + per-source caps for detail | No |
| Annual Review | Client360 brief, Advisor Intelligence, Advisor Work, Timeline, Compliance, portfolio | `annual_review_sessions` (advisor-activity: notes + checklist) | source domains | `annual_review.read/create/update` | No |
| Business Owner Planning | Organizations/ownership, Tax, Benefits, Insurance, Advisor Intelligence, Advisor Work, Timeline, Compliance, Annual Review | `business_planning_profiles` (succession/continuity facts) | source domains | `business_owner.read` (+ owning caps per section) | No |
| Enterprise Reporting (D.21) | Analytics (KPI read-model), Operations, Scheduling, Communications, Workflow, Advisor Work, Compliance, Opportunity, Campaign, Referral, Annual Review, Business Owner, Timeline | reporting definitions/config only (templates, definitions, dashboards/widgets, scorecards, KPI groups, saved views, schedules, export profiles, report runs) — **no KPI values** | any source datum; must not recalculate KPIs | `reporting.view/manage/templates/audit*/admin*` (KPI values via Analytics `compute_metric`, which enforces executive gating + scope) | No |

## 8. Identity and relationship model
Business entities are **not** a separate table: an organization is a `relationship_entities`
row (`entity_type='business'`) with a 1:1 `organization_profiles`. People and households are
promoted into `relationship_entities` (via `ensure_person_entity`/`ensure_household_entity`)
only when they participate in the relationship graph. Ownership is a `relationships` edge
(`owns`, category `ownership`) with a 1:1 `relationship_ownership` detail (percentages,
`is_direct`, evidence). The `relationships` table enforces a unique `(from, to, type)` edge.

## 9. Authorization and capability model
Capability-based RBAC. `Principal(user_id, email, display_name, capabilities: frozenset)` is
built per request from active role→capability grants. Routes gate with
`require_capability(code)` dependencies; middleware additionally maps route families to a
required capability with GET→`.read` / mutation→`.write` inference. **63 production
capabilities** are seeded across domain migrations (each migration inserts its capabilities and
grants them to roles). No single seed file; the capability table is the runtime source of
truth. (The shared test database may also contain ephemeral `e2_2.cap.*` fixtures — these are
test artifacts, not production capabilities.)

Capability inventory by domain (exact codes; `*` = sensitive):

- **Identity/admin:** `identity.manage*`, `role.manage*`, `team.manage`, `assignment.manage`,
  `record.read_all`, `record.write_all`, `audit.read*`.
- **Client:** `client.read`, `client.write`, `task.read`, `task.write`, `document.read`,
  `document.write`, `communication.read`, `communication.write`.
- **Work (legacy task/workflow):** `work.read`, `work.write`, `work.approve*`, `capacity.read*`.
- **Organization:** `organization.read`, `organization.write`.
- **Benefits/Retirement:** `benefits.read`, `benefits.write`, `benefits.enroll`,
  `benefits.compliance*`, `benefits.sensitive.read*`.
- **Insurance:** `insurance.read`, `insurance.write`, `insurance.suitability`, `insurance.scan`,
  `insurance.commissions.read`, `insurance.commissions.write`, `insurance.licensing.read`,
  `insurance.licensing.write`, `insurance.sensitive.read*`.
- **Tax:** `tax.read`, `tax.write`, `tax.review*`, `tax.deadline.manage*`, `tax.intake.read`,
  `tax.intake.write`, `tax.document.review*`.
- **Exceptions:** `exception.read`, `exception.write`, `exception.resolve*`,
  `exception.compliance*`.
- **Advisor Work:** `advisor_work.read`, `advisor_work.create`, `advisor_work.assign`,
  `advisor_work.update`.
- **Compliance / Reviewer Authority:** `compliance.review.read`, `compliance.review.submit`,
  `compliance.review.assign*`, `compliance.review.decide*`, `compliance.authority.read`,
  `compliance.authority.manage*`.
- **Timeline:** `timeline.read`.
- **Annual Review:** `annual_review.read`, `annual_review.create`, `annual_review.update`.
- **Business Owner Planning:** `business_owner.read`, `business_owner.update`,
  `business_owner.planning_update`.
- **Opportunity & Pipeline:** `opportunity.view`, `opportunity.edit`, `opportunity.delete*`,
  `opportunity.assign`, `opportunity.close`, `opportunity.report`, `opportunity.forecast*`.
- **Campaigns:** `campaign.view`, `campaign.edit`, `campaign.delete`, `campaign.report`,
  `campaign.archive`, `campaign.manage_budget*`, `campaign.manage_roi*`.
- **Referral Sources:** `referral.view`, `referral.edit`, `referral.delete`, `referral.report`.
- **Analytics:** `analytics.view`, `analytics.executive*`, `analytics.export`,
  `analytics.manage_targets`, `analytics.manage_dashboards`.
- **Documents:** `document.read`/`document.write` (legacy) + `documents.view/edit/delete/version/
  approve/archive/restore/export/manage_retention` (D.16 platform).
- **Workflow:** `work.read/write/approve` (legacy engine) + `workflow.view/edit/execute/cancel/
  template_manage/admin*/audit*` (D.17 orchestration).
- **Communications:** `communications.view/send/manage_templates/audit*/admin*` (D.18 platform;
  distinct from the legacy `communication.read/write` capabilities that gate the Microsoft 365 UI).
- **Scheduling:** `scheduling.view/manage/templates/audit*/admin*` (D.19 platform; the Microsoft 365
  calendar sync/review UI remains gated by the legacy `communication.read`).
- **Operations:** `operations.view/manage/templates/audit*/admin*` (D.20 firm-operations platform;
  distinct from client `task.read/write` and from Advisor Work `advisor_work.*`, which remain the
  authoritative client-task and client-work domains).
- **Reporting:** `reporting.view/manage/templates/audit*/admin*` (D.21 composition layer; KPI values
  are composed from Analytics — executive gating (`analytics.executive`) and record scope are
  inherited from the Analytics compute layer, never re-implemented).
- **Automation:** `automation.view/manage/execute/audit*/admin*` (D.22 orchestration layer; jobs
  dispatch to existing services via the `job_type` map — never duplicating business logic; scheduled
  runs execute with a system principal; `automation.execute` gates triggering).
- **Governance:** `governance.view/manage/review*/audit*/admin*` (D.23 governance domain; references
  canonical records, reuses the matching/merge + document-retention infra, never performs an unsafe
  merge or hard delete; merge apply / legal holds / deletion approval require `governance.review`).
- **Integration:** `integration.view/manage/execute/audit*/admin*` (D.24 integration domain; reuses
  importers/M365-OAuth/outbox/Fernet, never duplicates provider logic, stores no plaintext secret,
  no external broker; sync/verify/publish require `integration.execute`).
- **Security:** `security.view/manage/execute/audit*/admin*` (D.25 security domain; owns security
  metadata only — policies, providers, secret/certificate references, incidents, findings — reuses
  the existing authentication/RBAC/record-scope/Fernet-crypto/audit, never replaces login/OAuth,
  never stores a plaintext secret; policy approval / secret rotation / certificate renewal / incident
  & exception decisions / running reviews require `security.execute`).
- **Observability:** `observability.view/manage/execute/audit*/admin*` (D.26 platform-operations
  domain; owns observability metadata only — services, health/diagnostic checks, telemetry, alerts,
  runtime snapshots, reliability incidents/findings — reuses the existing health endpoints, scheduler
  snapshot, logging, and notification ledger, never replaces runtime health/logging/exception
  handling, never delivers a notification; scans / snapshot capture / alert ack-resolve / service &
  incident lifecycle require `observability.execute`; sensitive diagnostic detail requires
  `observability.audit`).
- **Configuration:** `configuration.view/manage/execute/audit*/admin*` (D.27 platform-configuration
  domain; owns configuration governance metadata only — categories/sets/items/versions, environment
  overrides, tenant/org/user preferences, feature groups/flags/rollouts, editions/edition-capabilities/
  license-policies/edition-assignments, platform options, administrative policies, runtime-setting
  references, snapshots, changes — reuses the runtime config `app.config` (references it, never
  re-reads env or replaces it), references RBAC `capabilities` and `organization_profiles`/`users`,
  has no runtime feature-toggle engine; set/policy/change approval, feature activation, edition
  assignment, and reviews require `configuration.execute`; sensitive item values require
  `configuration.audit`).
- **Runtime:** `runtime.view/manage/execute/audit*/admin*` (D.28 Runtime Configuration Engine; the
  runtime evaluation layer over D.27 metadata — deterministic resolution precedence, immutable
  effective-config snapshots, an in-process versioned cache, and feature/edition/rollout evaluation.
  It evaluates only and never edits configuration metadata; hydration is guarded so a config failure
  never blocks startup; every request gets one immutable runtime context. Refresh / snapshot build /
  cache rebuild require `runtime.execute`; the safety report requires `runtime.audit`; emergency
  overrides require `runtime.admin`).
- **Runtime cluster:** `/runtime/cluster` reuses the D.28 `runtime.*` capabilities (D.29 distributed
  coordination — makes the runtime engine cluster-safe using the transactional outbox as the sole
  coordination bus; a worker registry + heartbeats, a runtime generation/version history, and
  pull-based convergence off the persisted generation as the single source of truth. The engine
  remains the sole evaluator; coordination never edits metadata; coordinated refresh requires
  `runtime.execute`; diagnostics/event-history require `runtime.audit`; worker administration &
  emergency synchronization require `runtime.admin`).
- **Runtime consumption:** `/runtime/behavior` reuses the D.28 `runtime.*` capabilities (D.30
  behavioral adoption — application behavior consumes the runtime engine through a standardized,
  behavior-preserving consumption API (`RuntimeContext.config/feature_enabled/edition/license/
  capabilities`, `app/services/runtime/consumption.py`). Migrated switches: automation dispatch,
  analytics executive metrics, benefits detector windows, reporting optional modules, notification
  channels, Microsoft 365 sync + SharePoint scope — each with a legacy default so behavior is
  unchanged until a runtime value is defined. Infrastructure (DB/secrets/OAuth/crypto/logging/
  scheduler-registration/M365 credentials) stays a startup concern. Adoption is tracked in the
  `runtime_behaviors` registry; recording a behavior migrated/retired requires `runtime.admin`).

Role seeding (as currently seeded; `administrator` holds all): advisor gets client/work/
advisor_work/annual_review/business_owner/timeline; operations gets a read-leaning subset;
compliance gets client-read + compliance.* + audit.read + record.read_all; benefits_* and
insurance_* roles get their domain capabilities (sensitive reads only to the *compliance*
variant). Exact grants are in `docs/platform_architecture_manifest.yaml` and the DB.

## 10. Record-scope model
Scope is enforced **in services** (scope-first), with middleware covering common families:

- **Entity types that grant access:** `person`, `household`, `organization` (via
  `record_assignments`). `record_in_scope(principal, entity_type, id, *, write)` is
  entity-type-agnostic; `organization_in_scope` and `accessible_person_ids` are team-aware.
- **Middleware RECORD_PATH** `^/(people|households)/(\d+)` enforces person/household scope for
  those families; `/organizations`, `/benefits`, `/insurance`, `/tax`, `/documents`, `/work`
  map to a required capability via the RULES table (GET→`.read`).
- **Routes OUTSIDE shared scope middleware — service enforces scope itself:** `/advisor-work`,
  `/annual-review`, `/business-owner`, `/compliance` (these match no middleware RULE, so each
  handler uses `require_capability` + the service checks `record_in_scope`).
- **Validated-relationship fallback:** Business Owner Planning grants business visibility when
  the in-scope person has a **validated ownership relationship** to the business, or the
  business is independently in `organization_in_scope`. Never inferred from a name/free text.
- **Prohibited:** name-based or free-text scope inference; business-owner status from
  occupation/employer/tax-document presence.

## 11. Sensitive-data and redaction model
All redaction is server-side; templates receive already-redacted data. Restricted (lacks
capability) is distinguished from missing (no data).

| Datum | Capability to view | Behavior without it |
|---|---|---|
| EIN | `benefits.sensitive.read` | value withheld; `ein_present` flag from ciphertext (Fernet-encrypted at rest) so restricted ≠ missing |
| Policy numbers / values | `insurance.sensitive.read` | number withheld; presence flag retained |
| Benefits PHI / retirement PII | `benefits.sensitive.read` | omitted |
| Tax content | `tax.read` (+ review caps) | tax section marked *restricted* |

| Advisor-work notes (in timeline) | `advisor_work.read` | redacted summary |
| Documents / evidence | `document.read` | omitted |
| Client / planning notes | owning cap | omitted |

No secrets or encryption keys appear in code paths that reach templates or documentation.

## 12. Advisor Intelligence architecture
Deterministic, **not AI/LLM**. `get_client_signals(principal, person_id)` (scope-first) reads
existing operational data and emits `Signal`s in categories `recommendation`, `opportunity`,
`review`, `exception`, `task`, `meeting`. Recommendations carry a durable
`RecommendationMeta(recommendation_type, governing_rule, rule_version, compliance_owner,
approval_status)` and deterministic ids; policy gates are display-only placeholders. Signals
are recomputed at render time and have **no durable timestamp**, which is why the Activity
Timeline excludes them (including them would fabricate history). Consumers: Advisor Work
(create-from-recommendation), Compliance (submit review), Annual Review, Business Owner
Planning (grouped only by durable `recommendation_type` — never keyword-invented categories).

## 13. Advisor Work architecture
`advisor_work_items` + append-only `advisor_work_events`. Creation is **explicit** — either a
user action or `create_from_recommendation` (idempotent: at most one OPEN item per
recommendation/person/rule). **No automatic creation** from observations, renders, or
missing-information. Lifecycle is an explicit allowed-transition map (new → assigned →
in_progress/waiting → completed/cancelled/archived) — **not** a workflow engine. Completion
records operational activity only; it never suppresses or alters the underlying recommendation
or its id. Items anchor to person/household (no business link today). Separate from the legacy
`/work` + `work.*` task system.

## 14. Compliance architecture
Three parts: **Rule Catalog** (governed rule definitions + versions), **Compliance Review**
(`compliance_reviews` + append-only `compliance_decisions`), and **Reviewer Authority**
(`reviewer_authorities` + append-only `reviewer_authority_events`). Submit → assign → decide.
Final approval **double-gates** on `compliance.review.decide` **and** a recorded Reviewer
Authority (and a Rule-Catalog version match); without them, approval is blocked, never silently
granted. Advisor completion of work or an annual-review checklist is **not** regulatory
approval. Business Owner Planning and Annual Review consume compliance **status/counts** only —
never comments/evidence, and never make or certify a decision.

## 15. Activity Timeline and audit architecture
Distinct record types:

- **Activity Timeline** — a read **projection** (`activity_timeline`) over `timeline_events`
  plus domain ledgers via per-domain adapters. Deterministic `(occurred_at desc, stable-id
  desc)` ordering, stable event ids, bounded per-source (≤500) and page (≤100), server-side
  redaction. **No table of its own; no second event table.**
- **Domain timeline events** — `timeline_events` (one row per durable domain event; some older
  rows lack an actor).
- **Administrative audit log** — `audit_events` (append-only, `audit.read`) — a separate
  security record, not the advisor-facing timeline.
- **Append-only ledgers** — `advisor_work_events`, `compliance_decisions`,
  `reviewer_authority_events`, `exception_events`, `workflow_events`, tax `*_events`.
- **Mutable records** — `annual_review_sessions`, `business_planning_profiles`.

Business-planning profile changes emit durable events through the shared `add_timeline_event`
writer (creation / status change / valuation update), anchored to the owning person — **not** a
new event table. Client360 is **not** event-sourced.

## 16. Annual Review architecture
`annual_review_sessions` (mutable advisor-activity record: notes + presentation-only
checklist; lifecycle draft → in_progress → completed → archived; idempotent start via a
partial-unique OPEN guard). It composes Client360 brief, Advisor Intelligence, Advisor Work,
Timeline, Compliance, and portfolio, each gated on its owning capability. It changes no source
record. Routes `/annual-review/{person_id}`, `/annual-review/session/{id}`.

## 17. Business Owner Planning architecture
Anchored to a person; reaches businesses through the ownership graph via a **pure read**
(`list_person_business_ownership`) that never calls `ensure_person_entity` (no write on
render). Business-owner status derives only from an active ownership edge. Sole persistence:
`business_planning_profiles` (succession/continuity/buy-sell/valuation/key-person, controlled
status vocabulary) — the audit proved these facts have no other home. Additive owning-service
reads: `tax_domain.business_engagements`, `insurance.business_policies`,
`organization_service.list_person_business_ownership`/`list_household_business_ownership`.
Business scope = person-in-scope AND (validated ownership OR `organization_in_scope`) — blocks
URL enumeration. Routes `/business-owner/{person_id}` and `/business/{business_id}` (+ planning
POST). See `docs/PHASE_D12_BUSINESS_OWNER_PLANNING_WORKSPACE.md`.

## 18. Benefits, retirement, insurance, and tax boundaries
- **Retirement** is the retirement line of the Benefits domain (`benefit_plans` + retirement
  details), org-scoped. Contribution/limit amounts and Cash Balance/DB funding are **not
  modeled**; nothing is calculated.
- **Benefits** owns group health/retirement plans, plan years, obligations, enrollments.
  Employer-contribution amounts are not modeled. `benefits.sensitive.read` gates PHI/PII.
- **Insurance** is life/annuity only; disability/LTC and structured **policy purpose** are not
  modeled. `insurance.sensitive.read` gates policy numbers/values.
- **Tax** tracks engagements/returns/intake/lifecycle/documents (metadata + workflow) — **no
  return financial content** (K-1, W-2 wages, guaranteed payments, distributions, QBI,
  S-election, accounting method are not modeled). Tax scope is office/team + subject.

## 19. Importers and external-source boundaries
Do not claim live sync where only import infrastructure exists.

| Source | Status | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Schwab | importer implemented | `app/importers/schwab.py` (portfolio) |
| AssetMark | importer implemented | `app/importers/assetmark.py` |
| Wealthbox | importer implemented | `app/importers/wealthbox.py` (CRM contacts) |
| Dave Ramsey / SmartVestor | importer implemented | `app/importers/dave_ramsey.py` |
| Microsoft 365 | integration | OAuth + calendar/mail/documents routes (near-live) |
| TaxDome | not implemented | SOP reference only |
| Drake | not implemented | SOP reference only |
| Betterment | stub | disabled recordkeeper provider stub (retirement) |
| Guideline / Gusto | not implemented | comment-only / absent |

Imported records flow through source contacts/links and matching → canonical merge
(`person_merge`) into `people`. This is **import + reconciliation**, not continuous
synchronization.

## 20. Routes and application surfaces
**Verified total: 432 routes** (`python -c "from app.main import app; print(len(app.routes))"`;
guarded by `tests/test_f4_8_workflow_api.py` and `tests/test_f4_7_workflow_evidence.py`). Route
families: `/people`, `/households`, `/organizations` + `/api/v1/organizations`, `/benefits` +
`/api/v1/benefits`, `/insurance`, `/tax` (+ `/tax/intake`, `/tax/returns`, `/tax/documents`),
`/compliance`, `/advisor-work`, `/people/{id}/timeline` + `/households/{id}/timeline`,
`/annual-review`, `/business-owner`, `/opportunities` (+ `/opportunities/reports`), `/campaigns`,
`/referral-sources`, `/business-development`, `/analytics`, `/documents` (legacy) +
`/document-library` (platform), `/workflows` (legacy engine) + `/workflow-automation`
(orchestration), `/communications` (D.18 client engagement), `/scheduling` (D.19 meetings &
appointments), `/operations` (D.20 firm projects/tasks/capacity), `/reporting` (D.21 dashboards & BI),
`/automation` (D.22 jobs/schedules/runs), `/governance` (D.23 quality/lineage/retention),
`/integration` (D.24 connectors/webhooks/API/events), `/security` (D.25 policies/providers/secrets/
certificates/incidents/findings), `/observability` (D.26 services/health/diagnostics/telemetry/alerts/
reliability), `/configuration` (D.27 settings/features/editions/preferences/changes), `/runtime` (D.28 runtime
engine — effective config/features/snapshots/cache), `/runtime/cluster` (D.29 workers/versions/
convergence/diagnostics), `/runtime/behavior` (D.30 consumption/adoption registry), `/workspace`
(meeting), `/portfolio` +
`/wealth`, `/admin` (+ `/admin/audit`, rule-catalog, roles), `/microsoft365`, `/auth`, and JSON
`/api/v1/*`.

## 21. Database and migration architecture
- **Engine:** SQLAlchemy Core; `app/db.py` reflects the live schema; declared schema lives in
  `app/database/*_tables.py` registered via `define_*_tables(metadata)` in
  `app/database/schema.py` (25 registered modules: advisor_work, analytics, annual_review,
  automation, business_planning, campaign_referral, communication, compliance, configuration,
  document_platform, governance, identity, integration, observability, operations, opportunity,
  outbox, portfolio, reporting, runtime, runtime_behavior, runtime_coordination, scheduling, security,
  work — plus core tables inline in `schema.py`).
- **Alembic:** 75 migrations, **single head `z4e5f6a7b8c9`**; `alembic current == heads`.
  Recent chain: D.22 `t0e1f2a3b4c5` → D.23 `u1f2a3b4c5d6` → D.24 `v2a3b4c5d6e7` → D.25
  `w7a8b9c0d1e2` → D.26 `x8b9c0d1e2f3` → D.27 `y9c0d1e2f3a4` → D.28 `z0a1b2c3d4e5` → D.29
  `z2c3d4e5f6a7` → D.30 `z4e5f6a7b8c9`.
- **Capability-seeding pattern:** each domain migration inserts its capabilities and grants
  `role_capabilities` idempotently.
- **Downgrade expectations:** every recent migration is reversible (down removes its
  table(s)/index(es) and capabilities); verified for D.9–D.12.
- **Prohibition:** no parallel heads unless intentionally merged; no squashing/renaming in
  D.12A.

## 22. Testing and architectural enforcement
- **Route-count guards:** `tests/test_f4_7_workflow_evidence.py`, `tests/test_f4_8_workflow_api.py`.
- **Golden regression:** `tests/test_intelligence_refactor_regression.py` (D.5) pins serialized
  signals + rendered panels.
- **Dependency-direction tests:** each composition phase asserts source domains don't import it
  (D.10/D.11/D.12).
- **Platform enforcement (new):** `tests/test_platform_architecture.py` validates the manifest
  against live code — route count, migration head, capability existence, module existence,
  import direction, schema registration, single head, and required doc sections.

## 23. Current limitations
Consolidated, honest register (D.9–D.12):
- Advisor Intelligence recommendations have **no durable timestamp** → excluded from the
  Timeline (not fabricated).
- Advisor Work items and Compliance reviews carry **no business link** (person/household only).
- **No per-client servicing-advisor field** — the "advisor" shown is the current principal.
- **Tax return financial content, owner compensation, insurance policy purpose, disability/LTC,
  retirement contribution amounts, business valuation** are **not modeled** (shown "Not
  available").
- **Succession/continuity data is prospective only** (no backfill — would fabricate).
- **Historical household-membership windows** are not modeled (current membership only).
- Some **older `timeline_events` lack an actor**.
- Ownership "conflicts across sources" cannot be represented while `relationships` enforces
  unique `(from, to, type)` edges (detector retained for future).
- Household ownership summary does one ownership read per member (bounded by household size).
- Betterment/Guideline/Gusto provider integrations are stubs; TaxDome/Drake are SOP references
  only.

No route/capability inconsistencies or upward-dependency defects were found in the D.12A audit.

## 24. Extension points
Not implemented; documented so future phases don't duplicate logic.

| Extension | Likely owner | Should consume | Must not duplicate | Prerequisite | Timing |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Opportunity/sales pipeline | ~~future~~ **implemented D.13** (source domain) | Advisor Intelligence, Advisor Work | recommendation/work logic | done — see ADR-018 | done |
| Household relationship intelligence | Relationships | relationship graph | ownership/relationship tables | richer relationship types | D.13+ |
| Estate planning | new source domain | People/Households, documents | none | new structured tables | later |
| Executive compensation | Benefits or new domain | Benefits, Organizations | benefits/plan tables | comp schema | later |
| Advanced retirement strategies | Benefits (retirement) | benefit plans | plan tables | contribution schema (currently absent) | later |
| Tax-return structured data | Tax | tax engagements | engagement metadata | new return-content tables + import | D.13+ |
| Business valuation | Business Owner Planning or new | business entities | ownership/profile tables | valuation schema | later |
| Exit planning | Business Owner Planning | succession/valuation | planning profile | valuation prerequisite | later |
| Document intelligence | Documents | documents/evidence | evidence tables | classification infra | later |
| Client portal / notifications / integrations | Portal / Outbox | existing services | domain data | already partial infra | later |

## 25. Prohibited patterns
- Composition layers persisting or mutating source-domain data.
- Client-side security enforcement; template-only redaction of sensitive data.
- Inferring ownership or business-owner status from names/occupation/free text.
- Fabricating history, calculations, tax figures, contribution limits, valuations, or
  insurance needs.
- A second recommendation engine, AI/LLM, or keyword-invented recommendation categories.
- A workflow engine, event bus, message queue, or automatic Advisor Work creation.
- A second timeline-event table or treating Client360 as event-sourced.
- Upward/circular service imports (producer importing a consumer or composition layer).
- Write side effects during page-render reads.
- Additive reads placed outside their owning service.
- Regulatory approval outside authorized Compliance workflows.

## 26. Architecture change process
1. Audit code first; do not document aspirationally.
2. Keep the owning service authoritative; add only *additive reads* there.
3. New composition layers consume, never duplicate; persist only genuinely-new data proven to
   have no home.
4. Add capabilities per domain migration; enforce server-side; gate sensitive data.
5. Keep migrations linear (single head); make them reversible.
6. Update `docs/platform_architecture_manifest.yaml` **and** this document together; keep
   `tests/test_platform_architecture.py` green.
7. Bump route-count guards deliberately when adding routes.

## 27. Glossary
- **Source domain** — authoritative owner of a data type.
- **Composition layer** — read-first assembler that consumes source domains; never a source of
  truth.
- **Principal** — the authenticated user + capability set for a request.
- **Record scope** — per-record access via `record_assignments` (person/household/organization),
  team-aware for some helpers.
- **Append-only ledger** — a table protected by a mutation-blocking trigger (corrections add a
  new row).
- **Projection** — a read-only view assembled from other tables (Activity Timeline).
- **Restricted vs missing** — restricted = data exists but the principal lacks the capability;
  missing = no data recorded.
